## Memorama game with logos of football clubs

**Memorama** is a game where you find cards with the same symbols.  
In this game I used logos of football clubs as symbols on the cards (that's why I named it **Clubrama**).  
**Clubrama** has 3 levels. Passing to each level the game gets harder by adding more cards into the grid.

## Here is how it looks like:

## Why did I make this game?
I like making games, and I wanted to impove my coding skills by making this project.  
I did my best making this game, so I hope you will try it :)  

## Feel free to leave feedback about the project, it'll be very helpful.  

# Thanks!
